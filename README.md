## Introduction

**Chess** is a simple chess project developed with the primary goal of learning game development processes and exploring the possibility of integrating third-party artificial intelligence (AI). This project provides a basic platform for playing chess, while also opening up many potentials for future development.

## Features

Currently, Chess supports the following core features:

  * **Player vs. Player:** Two players can take turns making moves on the same computer.
  * **Player vs. Bot:** Experience playing chess against a computer opponent powered by *Stockfish*.
  * **Upcoming Features:** We are actively working on adding more exciting features in the future!

## Technologies Used

This project is built entirely using:

  * **Java:** The primary programming language.
  * **Java Swing:** The GUI (Graphical User Interface) library used to construct the game's interface.
  * **Stockfish Chess Engine:** Integrated to provide strong AI opposition.
